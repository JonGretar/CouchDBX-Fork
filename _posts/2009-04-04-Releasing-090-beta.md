title: Releasing 0.9.0
---

With the release of CouchDB 0.9.0 I am updating CouchDBX to a beta of the same version.
It still has the same problem of needing manual installation of the icu package to run. 

To install icu first you need to install macports and then icu using:
    sudo port install icu

We are all working really hard to resolve this issue.
