title: My CouchDBX Version
---

Hey people.

I have been playing with Jan's CouchDBX a bit and thought someone might enjoy what I did. CouchDBX is a nice little Mac OS X tool to run CouchDB without the need to set up Erlang or anything.

There are 3 major changes that I did. First of the UI is gone and everything is now in a status bar menu. Should make for quicker access to it and also stay out of the way. There is also a new transparent log window if you need to see what is happening on the Erlang level. The third an most important change is that CouchDBX now stores it's database in ~/Documents/CouchDB. Before the database was inside the Application bundle itself and all the data disappeared every time you downloaded a new release of CouchDBX.

I have not renamed it or anything in case Jan would like to incorporate these changes to the original code or something.
